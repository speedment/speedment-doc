## Per Minborg
This manual was written by me, Per-Ã…ke Minborg, but of course I got a lot of help from my colleagues and feedback from the community. Any error in the documentation is to be blamed on me solely.

## Emil Forslund
I guess I helped some as well. I like to write about the Enterprise functionality and also did some css-magic. I agree with Per. Blame him.
