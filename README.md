# speedment-doc
The documentation for the Speedment Product Suite consisting of: 
- Speedment Open Source 
- Speedment Stream
- Speedment HyperStream
- Hazelcast Auto Database Integration 

### PDF rendering of the documentation
Speedment does currently not provide the documentation in PDF-format. Although, individual chapters of the documentation can be obtained in PDF-format by installing the [GitPrint-plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gitprint/igmdhkjenljbkggljeobknjgehilnjmp) for Chrome. 

The plugin enables Markdown-documents hosted on Github to be rendered as PDF by replacing "github" in the file-path to the md-file with "gitprint". All chapter source files can be found [here](https://github.com/speedment/speedment-doc/blob/master/pages/).

For example: 
"https://gitprint.com/speedment/speedment-doc/blob/master/pages/advanced_features.md" will yield a PDF-version of the chapter on Advanced Features. Although, do note that the PDF-rendering has some flaws.
